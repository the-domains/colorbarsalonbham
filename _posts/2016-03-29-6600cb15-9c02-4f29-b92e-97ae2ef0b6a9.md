the art and science of pure flower and plant essences is the core of aveda. our beauty products are alive with the life force of plants, and contain pure essential oils. our solutions are so powerful we call them purescriptions(tm). while we specialize in hair care, we offer other plant-based products---skin care, makeup, pure-fume(tm), aromas and lifestyle---that are all professionally developed, clinically tested, and go to exceptional lengths to be respectful of the earth. our professional network, nearly 8,000 salons and spas worldwide, shares our commitment. ever since a hairdresser founded aveda in 1978, our products have been harvested with respect for the earth, in harmony with the web of life.
aveda: connecting beauty, environment and well-being.
